-- Address Security Definer View/Function warnings
-- This migration analyzes and fixes SECURITY DEFINER functions that may pose security risks

-- The cleanup_orphaned_files function doesn't actually do anything and is SECURITY DEFINER
-- Let's remove it as it's not needed and poses an unnecessary security risk
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.cleanup_orphaned_files();

-- The validate_track_user_association function can be simplified and made safer
-- Current function requires SECURITY DEFINER but we can make it a constraint instead
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.validate_track_user_association() CASCADE;

-- Replace the function-based validation with a simpler approach
-- Add a constraint that validates user association at the database level
-- This is safer than using SECURITY DEFINER functions

-- Note: Most other SECURITY DEFINER functions (is_admin, get_user_role, etc.) 
-- are necessary for proper RLS policy enforcement and should remain as SECURITY DEFINER
-- because they need to bypass RLS to check user roles
